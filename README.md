# Ripple-Carry-Adder-4bit
This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) using Verilog. A Ripple Carry Adder is one of the simplest forms of binary adders, where the carry output from each full adder is passed (or "rippled") to the next. It serves as a foundational concept in digital electronics and computer architecture.
